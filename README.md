# SPAM-DETECTION-AND-FAKE-USER-IDENTIFICATION-ON-SOCIAL-NETWORK


# üõ°Ô∏è Spam Detection and Fake User Identification on Social Network

This project focuses on detecting spam content and identifying fake users on social networking platforms using machine learning and data analysis techniques. It aims to enhance the integrity and safety of online communities by minimizing malicious activities such as spamming, impersonation, and bot-generated content.

## üöÄ Features

- Spam message detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Fake account identification using behavioral patterns and profile analysis
- Machine learning models for classification (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Dataset preprocessing and feature engineering
- Visualization of user behavior and model performance

## üìä Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy (for NLP tasks)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Flask (for deploying the model - optional)

‚úÖ How to Run

1.Install requirements (if needed):
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn joblib

2.Run the script:
python spam_detector.py

3.Test the API (optional):
{
  "text": "Congratulations, you won!"
}

**You can test it using Postman, curl, or even Python requests**
